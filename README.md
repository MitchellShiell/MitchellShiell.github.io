Ological Website

Hey! My names Mitchell Shiell, I'm a trained scientist, dedicated educator and passionate creative. I love teaching yet currently cannot afford the cost of teachers college. However, teachers teach so i hope to use this website to do just that. I created this space originally as my first coding project but hope to expand it as my experimental laboratory/showcase for educational content.
